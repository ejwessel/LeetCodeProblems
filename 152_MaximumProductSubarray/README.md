## Maximum Product Subarray

I was super close identifying this solution.
I ended up abandoning the solution because I couldn't wrap my head around it

I could identify the naive solution, but that doesn't help me all that much.

here's a bad analogy
```buildoutcfg
you are going through life
and you have a series of bad experiences
and a series of good experiences
experiences can compound
sometimes a good experience can turn prior experiences bad
and sometimes  bad experience can turn prior experiences good
(your perspective changes)
however maybe the experience you are dealing with currently is the best experience that beats all prior compounded experiences
in that case
you start from that frame of reference
```

I think the problem with this problem is:
```
like is there a patten here or idea i can reuse?
otherwise just knowing how to do this porblem isnt going to do much
```

That's my problem with this problem

Runtime: O(n)
- look at all numbers once

Space: O(1)
- no space other than keeping 2 running path totals and a max sum at every iteration
