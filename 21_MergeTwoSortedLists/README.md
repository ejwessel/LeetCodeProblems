# MergeTwoSortedLists

Both solutions are
- Runtime: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

## Solution 1
- It has 3 logic blocks
- First block handles merging two lists together
- The last two blocks handle what happens when one of the lists is empty

## Solution 2
- It has 3 logic blocks
- First block handles merging two lists together and handles what happens when one of the lists is empty
- This solution is interesting since it's faster than the first solution, but arguably more confusing to understand
- This goes to show that you can optimize like crazy, but code becomes much harder to understand.
