# Solution 1
Brute force solution
## Runtime Analysis
Every element is checked against every element
O(n^2)
## Space Analysis
No extra space is used
O(1)

# Soultion 2
Optimal solution
Unfortunately I was unable to come up with this solution. I new there was a way to optimize and not look at every element, but this solution eluded me.
I looked at various ways to skip elements or eliminate looking at elements, but I couldn't come up with how to do it with this problem
## Runtime Analysis
All elements are looked at each once
O(n)
## Space Analysis
No extra space is used
O(1)
