# PowXY

Runtime:
- runtime is dependent on how fast n (the exponent) can be reduced
- the faster we can reduce n the better
- n decreases exponentially in our problem using the optimal method. This is similar to a half life
- for large values of n the amount of work to do over n is orders of magnitude smaller
- log(n) is the number of times n is reduced.
- O(logn)

Space:
- no data structures are kept, only the intermittent product, total product, and a counter. 
- O(1)
