## Partition List

My initial solution to this is ugly because I don't separate the linked lists
It's probably better to connect the linked lists afterwards.
This would prevent the duplicate code at the bottom before returning

Runtime: O(n)
- every element is looked at once

Space: O(1)
- no additional space is used
