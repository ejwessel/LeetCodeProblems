# ReverseInteger

## Solution 1:
- Runtime: O(n)
  - needs to look through the entire number in string form
  
- Space: O(n)
  - intermittently saves the string

## Solution 2:
- Runtime: O(n)
  - needs to look up to half the string to reverse it
- Space: O(n)
  - itermittently saves the new string
