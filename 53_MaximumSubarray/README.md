## Maximum Subarray

I was able to correctly identify the problem and how to do about it linearly, but I failed to code it properly for both the naive and the optimal solution

I had an index issue with naive and I had a max issue with the optimal.
Idk if it was because I was lazy or cocky

Runtime: O(n)/O(n^2)
- linear time for optimal
- quadratic for inoptimal

Space: O(1)
