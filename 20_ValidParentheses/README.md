# ValidParentheses

I didn't get this problem the first time, probably due out of laziness, however I didn't not understand the problem as identifying where the algorithm didn't go correctly was easy to fix.

- Runtime: O(n)
  - every character needs to be looked at
- Space: O(n)
  - I keep a stack and in the worse case nothing is popped off
