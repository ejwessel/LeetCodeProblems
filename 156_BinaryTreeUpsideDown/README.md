## Binary Tree Upside Down

This problem was terribly frustrating to understand. Once I understood what was being asked I was able to do this problem with no difficulty.
The only issue I had was not unlinking the previous node.

Runtime: O(n)
- tree is imbalanced to the left

Space: O(n)
- recursive stack grows linearly as we visit the left node
