## Subarray Sum Equals K

I was able to immediately identify this problem as DP
I was unable to code the DP solution
I was able to identify other solutions, but by the end of the I didn't have anything since I had no DP solution

Runtime: O(n)
- dp solution is O(n) as I look at every element once

Space: O(n)
- I need to keep all sums in memory

naive solutions are O(n^2) runtime and O(1) memory
