# PalindromeNumber

- Runtime: O(n)
  - I loop through the list. The first loop populates the numbers in a list
  - The second loop, loops through half the list and checks the opposing side of the list to see if the numbers match
- Space: O(n)
  - a number list is kept which is the same size as the length of the incoming number
  
  
Note: I don't convert the incoming number into a string. I use pre math.
