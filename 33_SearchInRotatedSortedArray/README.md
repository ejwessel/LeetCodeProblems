# SearchInRotatedSortedArray

This was a fun problem

- The algorithm works by recursively breaking the array with binary search.
- The base idea is to do a binary search, but be selective of which side to go down
- The ability to pick a side and know with likliness it will be in that side is what makes this algorithm O(logn)
-

- Runtime: O(logn)
- Space: O(logn)
